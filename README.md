# Actor Collaboration Network
In this project we use the tools offered by network analysis to explore the collaboration patterns in the movie industries all over the world. 
This repository contains:
1. The code collaboration_network.ipynb where we have constructed the network, compute the centrality measure, study its community/clustering structure and the assortative mixing.
2. The code network_pert.ipynb where we study the tolerance of the network under attack/error.
3. The code powerlaw.ipynb where we look at the degree distribution and perform a comparison with another scale-free network, the Barabasi-Albert model.


The report of our activies and the references are in the file report.pdf


The data that we have used is the IMDb dataset, which is freely available at [this link](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/)
